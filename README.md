# FlashDex Arbitrage with AAVE FlashLoan Integration
This project utilizes a combination of Arbitrage-Dex, FlashLoan functionality from AAVE, and a Node.js Express server with an API to predict BTC token prices. The purpose of this project is to enable users to leverage flash loans to perform arbitrage trading on decentralized exchanges (Dex) while using the AAVE protocol.

# Features 8
* Arbitrage-Dex: The project provides functionality for arbitrage trading on decentralized exchanges, taking advantage of price differences between various platforms.

* FlashLoan from AAVE: Flash loans allow users to borrow a large sum of assets within a single transaction as long as the borrowed amount is returned within the same transaction. This feature enables users to perform arbitrage trading without the need for large capital.

* BTC Token Price Prediction: The API also includes a prediction mechanism to estimate the future price of BTC tokens. This functionality can help users make informed decisions when executing their arbitrage trades.
